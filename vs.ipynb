        "Now that we have learned about working with different types of data in Python: strings, numbers (ints and floats), and booleans, let's put that knowledge to the test. In this lab we'll imagine that we were at a nice social gathering and exchanged business cards with a few people. One of the business cards belongs to Art Vandelay, a new travel agent. We want to use our programming skills to format this information correctly.\n",
